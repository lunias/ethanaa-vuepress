  Like a plumber's wrench or a carptenter's hammer and saw, a keyboard is indispensible to the programmer. 
  As mechanical keyboards have have gone more mainstream; there's been an explosion of key switches, cases, 
  and PCBs to accomodate any preference. The question is: how many more will I buy before I'm satisfied?

## The [Happy Hacking Keyboard (HHKB) Pro 2](https://deskthority.net/wiki/HHKB_Professional2)

I bought this keyboard in college (10+ years ago) - and it was considerably out
of my budget. I originally had my eye on a [Das
Keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/) with [Cherry
Blue](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Blue) key switches, but the unit
that I was shipped suffered from a key transposition issue (which has since been
remedied in later revisions) forcing me to return it. After that I decided to
splash a bit more cash on what many considered an end-game keyboard at the time.
I do not regret it. I'm typing this article on that same HHKB and it looks and
performs just like the day I bought it.

### One Layout to Rule Them All

I use [Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Emacs). For those unfamiliar,
it's a text editor that was originally designed on / for the [Symbolics
Space-cadet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard) keyboard.

![Space-cadet Keyboard Layout](./img/space_cadet.gif)

The Space-cadet had more modifiers than any keyboard before it. And Emacs makes
use of these extensively; especially CTRL and META, SUPER and HYPER to a much
lesser extent. On a standard US QWERTY board the CTRL key is in a position that
leads to it being pressed primarily by an awkwardly contorted pinky finger,
potentially causing an uncomfortable condition dubbed [Emacs
pinky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs#Emacs_pinky).

The Space-cadet was succeeded by the simpler, but still specialized (and cool!)
[Symbolics
Keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics#Symbolics_keyboard).

I was interning at IBM and found a quality [IBM Model
M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard) abandoned in a lab that I
made into my daily-driver at work, but I've never come across anything as
exotic as either of those two legendary boards. In order to avoid RSI on a
standard QWERTY, I would swap CAPS LOCK and CTRL in software, but this isn't a
great solution because it's not portable. If you're working on a new machine,
then you need to do tedious OS-specific configuration in order to get back to a
productive state. The HHKB layout takes this common desire of Emacs users into
account by placing CTRL right on the home row (where it belongs :wink:). Of
course muscle memory sets in and now I need to bring my keyboard with me
whenever I have some real work to do.

*This* is my favorite layout. The HHKB layout; most similar to the [Sun Type
3](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Sun_Type_3) keyboard.

:::quote Common features
- The control key is found where most keyboards place the caps lock. This is the
  only control key on the keyboard.
- The esc key is located to the left of the 1 key; the tilde key normally found
  there is at the right end of the same row.
- The delete key is located directly above the enter key; the key normally found
  there is the second-rightmost key on the row above it. Furthermore, this is an
  actual delete key, not a historically named backspace. Backspace is accessible
  through Fn+Delete though its function can be interchanged with the backspace
  key using a DIP switch, using this setting, the delete key is accessed via
  Fn+`
- The meta keys are located between the space bar and the alt keys.
