# About Me

My name is Ethan Anderson; I am 31 years old and I currently live in Minnesota, just northwest of Minneapolis.

I enjoy creating software that is meaningful, accessible, and focused. The majority of my experience has lent itself to building server-side applications and web services, but I'm also motivated to continuously improve my skills in front end development and UX design. I believe strongly in the value of delivering customized software solutions which are polished and useable. I have a background building applications from start to finish, both on my own and in collaboration with a team.

In my personal life I love writing code, watching movies, rock climbing, playing boardgames, and spending time with friends and family.
